    <h1 class="vertical-line">Describing the purpose of Information Technology (IT) in modern business e.g how and why is it important: </h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      Technology helps a business understand its cash flow needs and preserve precious resources, such as time and physical space. For instance, with proper technology in place, a business can save time and money by holding meetings over the internet instead of at corporate headquarters. Moreover, a business with the right technological capacity will stay a step ahead of its competition. The internet allows a business to virtually travel into new markets without the cost of an executive jet or the risk of creating a factory abroad [1]. Moreover, with the advancement of artifical intelligence and automation, modern business technology is reaching new heights in terms of the speediness of operations, collecting and processing data and information, something which traditionally took a long time. For instance, in fintech, technological automation has made the underwriting process simple and faster.

    <p>
      Some businesses might use spreadsheets to track their team’s task, which can be a cumbersome and time consuming process for
      both managers and team members. Whereas using a task management software to automate task tracking and visualise task status can save time.
      For instance, Software’s such as Trello have built-in calendars and Kanban dashboards, which help managers track tasks more effectively. Click below
      to see my Trello board [3]

    <h1 class="center">Describe the risks that might impact digital projects:</h1> 
    <p class="center">
      Examples of risks that might impact digital products include: not being engaged. It is important to make sure your team has sufficient capacity to be able to work with your agency when feedback or approval, or when questions come up. On the
      flip side, having too many people engaged can also cause chaos and lack of decision making. Secondly, not keeping your organisation up to date. The last thing that you want to have happen is to work with your agency to come up with a beautiful
      final design only to unveil it to executives who will inevitably have changes. Finally, not planning for post-launch. The new life of your digital project is just beginning, so you will need to make sure that there are people and budget
      allocated to support your new website operationally [4].
    </p>

    <br>

    <h1 class="center">Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software:</h1> 
    <p class="center">
      Each time you start a new project with a client, the first problem to solve is to choose the right technology for the project. How you chose the right technology depends on the projects scope and intended purpose. Take a start-up, for example,
      its primary objective is to hit the market as fast as it can. So, the best choice could be an Ionic application. This would entail one codebase with an easy to learn framework in order to keep velocity high enough. In other words, it’s about
      choosing a technology you need to know “why” your client needs, and not only “what” that project intends to do [5].
    </p>

    <br>

    <h1 class="center"> How have your chosen technologies helped you achieve your outcomes:</h1>

    <br>
    <p class="center">
      There is a plethora of advantages in using Trello and GitHub, my two preferred choice of applications. Trello is an incredibly web-based project management and collaboration tool that has allowed me to plan my projects in one platform. It is
      incredibly visual and highly adaptable, which has made my life easier when using several people working on projects, especially when they are scattered across different physical locations. Conversely, GitHub has a number of features and tools
      for basic task management. It is useful in that it has allowed me to host my source code projects in a variety of different programming languages. It also allows a community of people to share collaborative efforts especially in reviewing,
      improving, and deriving new ideas from the uploaded code [6].

    <br>

    <h1 class="center">Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects:</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="center">
      There are a number of legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects. For instance, there are rules covering marketing emails and SMS messages to individuals, websites should carry the company’s registered address and company
      (or charity) registration number. In 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became law. This is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals who live in the
      European Union.
