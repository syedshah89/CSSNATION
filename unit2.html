    <h1>You are setting up as an independent consultant, which is very exciting, however, you’re going to need a website of your own to highlight your skills, availability and areas of work. It’s time for you to create a website that details you,
      and including pages/sections and a how you built it.</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      <strong>(1) Describing the content and layout for each page</strong>
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>In terms of context, I would begin with a home page with a brief introduction about my services and what we do, e.g. to provide our clients with holistic solutions which are smart, effective and affordable. I would then list my services on my home page to showcase the kind of work we undertake e.g web design, brand design, content marketing, SEO, PPC Marketing and Social Media, which are common across digital agencies. I would create an illustration for each service to make the website look visually attractive. I would include a portfolio of some of our best work in the style of a blog in grid view, with a link to access each project and further information about the project. I would have an icon list in a single row with the logo of companies we have worked with and a general blog page. I would have a header and footer with navigation links to the different services we offer, as well as how to get in touch and work with us, including social media icons.   </p>

    <br>

    <p>
      <strong>(2) Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</strong>
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>There can be a number of copyright issues effecting websites, this could be using the logo of other companies without their consent or being an affiliate, using a logo that looks like one that has already been trademarked, using information from other websites without seeking the authors permission, not following GDPR legal rules when handling personal data. Other constraints may include security threats to the website. If you are hosting your website on a shared server, this can be considered a constraint, both from the perspective of how secure it is and how fast it takes to load. Another constraint is visibility. Companies providing a service in the same industry as me, might be more visible because they are fully utilising SEO and marketing services. Language is another constraint affecting websites, if someone does not understand English, they would want the option of reading the website in their own language.   </p>

    <br>

    <p>
      <strong>(3) Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them </strong>
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>In terms of accessibility, two issues spring to mind. The first being deafness, although most of the content will be in written form, people with deafness may find it difficult to understand video illustrations, interviews and testimonials. In order to overcome this constraint, I would include subtitles. Secondly, the user may have cognitive difficulties, such as dyslexia where letters or numbers are switched. This can be overcome by avoiding pages with long blocks of texts. From a designers perspective, information should be broken up with numbers or bullets, or illustrations. Other accesibility issues include limited hand motor skills, sight hindrances, involuntary motion, neurological disorders, inability to speak and sensitivity to color. </p>

    <br>

    <p>
      <strong>(4) Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites</strong>
    </p>

  <br>

    <p> There are many file types that are appropriate for websites. For images, SVG, PNG, JPG, GIF are the most popular file formats. In terms of web files, HTML, CSS and Javascript are most commonly used.  </p>
