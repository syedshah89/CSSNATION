    <br>
     <p>
       During the project of making this website, I was happy with the tools that I used. I used Visual Studio at work and atom at home and Trello to set to do tasks, keep track of on-going or in progress tasks and completed tasks.

    <h1 class="vertical-line">Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate in the project e.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello:</h1> 
    <br>
    <p>
      I found Visual Studio Code very helpful, the software is open source, completely free of charge and also has a huge community backing it. Moreover, the software has literally thousands of extensions and they’re all mostly just a single click away. Furthermore, the git command lines, such as git init, git status, git push and commit make updating files on github simple and easy. Trello was also helpful and I believe the two go well together. Trello has allowed me to structure and organise my tasks with its Kanban calendar features. This has allowed me to stay on top of my progress at a glance, which is effective from a planning, management and visual perspective. It is also highly useful for collaborative efforts, when working as part of a team. Trello puts the project into perspective and helps teams create a measured expectation of each others contributions.

    <h1 class="vertical-line">Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? :</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      From a visual perspective, I could make this project much better. There are a lot of things I would do differently, for instance, I would use different fonts, I would use illustrations. In my opinion, this website looks a bit boxy. There is always room for improvement, design wise. On the flip side, the font is not too bad, it looks fairly decent on mobile view and the information is clearly readible.

    <p>
      When I set out to make the website, I was hoping it would be responsive. However, as the website developed I realised it was not responsive the way I wanted it to be on different screens. In future, I would use Jquery and Bootstrap to achieve this. Also, at the end of the project I glanced over my CSS code and realised it need could be better structured. I did use the command line in places but it was not enough. I felt this was important because
      although I know what's happening in the file, it might just look like a mess to someone more experienced than myself who is wanting to go into the file to make updates, changes or amendments.
    </p>

    <h1 class="vertical-line">Describe whether or not you could impliment further improvements to your project e.g responsive:</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      Definately! I would use bootsrap instead of flexbox in terms of code source. I would make a hamburger icon for mobile view to improve the UX/UI experience. I would use icons for illustration purposes. I would simplifiy the website as much as possible in a way that gets the message across more visually. I would create a proper blog page to seperate subjects, I would incorporate categories and tags into the website. I would include a message bot and include a a sign up feature to keep people engaged. In terms of structure also, I would use collapsibles, especially for things like Questions and Answers.
