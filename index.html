      <h1>My Profile</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Hello there, my name is Syed Shah. I came to codenation because I want to build my career as a full stack developer. I feel very optimistic about the prospects of an apprenticeship through the program and what it can offer in terms of
        career progression. So far my experience at codenation has been exciting. I have thoroughly enjoyed working in a team, developing an app in Xcode. Moreover, the activities set by my instructor have been intellectually stimulating. I believe
        I have the capacity to learn and grow as a developer and an apprenticeship would allow me to take my knowledge and experiences to the next level in terms of complexity and scope.
      </p>

    <p>I love socialising, I am a huge fan of speciality coffee shops (i.e. coffee shops that sell ethically sourced coffee beans, not only does it taste better, but it is healthier for you too. I love travelling, getting to know people from
      different backgrounds and professions and i just love creating things. Want to know more about me, feel free to contact me :)
