    <h1>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      There are many ways to improve productivity and efficiency. For the purpose of this project, I will mention a few. Firstly, itâ€™s important to take regular breaks because this can increase concentration. Some research has shown that taking short breaks during long tasks helps you to maintain a constant level of performance. It is also important to set self-imposed deadlines. A manageable load of self imposed stress can be helpful in terms of focus and meeting deadlines. Another important one is to be proactive, not reactive. In other words, having a plan of attack for each day to stick to can be highly effective.

    <h1>What would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack:</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      There are a number of things I would do to improve my own productivity in future projects. I would bring a team together to focus on different aspects of the projects. For instance, it would give me more capacity to focus on the front end, if one person was dealing with the web content, since producing content can alone take up a lot of time. Secondly, I would have a UX/UI designer create a prototype of the project in Sketch or Adobe XD. Not only would this give me a template design to follow, which everyone can agree on, but it would also allow me to measure expectations, speed production time up and ensure quality of service. To coordinate and collaborate these efforts, I would definately use Slack, Trello and GitHub together - to ensure consistency and accuracy.

    <h1>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions :</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      There are many platforms on which the digital solutions can be tested from web testing, mobile testing, app testing and API testing solutions. Besides the aforementioned, I may also carry out field research, to get the feedback of potential end users. That being said, sometimes the best way to test a digital product is to let it loose to the public, as the response can be a good indication of where one is going right or wrong. It also helps confirm certain aspects of the project are working or not working, and whether there is enough exposure to the intended target auidence.
